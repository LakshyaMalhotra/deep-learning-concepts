# Learning Neural Networks
This repository contains various projects related to vision, text, etc which I did to learn the concepts better. All of these are more or less complete but need some cosmetic changes like formatting, adding a README for each project. As of now, they are little unorganized and work in progress.
The following project sub-repositories are there in this repo:

- Visualizing the Convolutional Neural Networks
- Weight Initialization
- Autoencoders
- Neural Style Transfer
- Character level RNN
- Implementing Backpropagation

All of these will be updated soon.
