# Learning Neural Networks
This repository contains various projects related to computer vision, natural language processing which I did as an attempt to understand the stuff better. New stuff is keep on added in this repo. Most of the projects here are evolved from the experimentation with various things like hyperparameters or other fine tunings.

The following projects repositories are available:

- Visualizing the Convolutional Neural Networks
- Weight Initialization
- Autoencoders
- Neural Style Transfer
- Character level RNN
- Implementing Backpropagation
- Word2Vec using SkipGram
